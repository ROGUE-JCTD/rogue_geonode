Layer Detail Tabs
-----------------

There are up to four tabs that describe a layer: :guilabel:`Info`, :guilabel:`Attributes`, :guilabel:`History`, and :guilabel:`Comments`. 

#. The :guilabel:`Info` tab is the default tab, and presents basic information about the layer.  It also shows the overall average rating, and allows you to rate the layer.

#. The :guilabel:`Attributes` tab lists the attributes of the layer, including statistics (range, average, median and standard deviation).  Layer attribute statistics are made available only for numeric attributes.  If a layer's attributes are not numeric, then no statistics will be calculated.

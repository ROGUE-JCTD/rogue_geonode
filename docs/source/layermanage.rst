Editing Metadata and Managing Layers
=====================================

Every layer has its own page with information about it.  The layer page also provides a menu for options to edit information about the layer and manage the layer.

#. Click Update at the bottom of the form to save the changes

Edit Permissions
----------------
Layer permissions are set at the time of import. Permissions can be adjusted as needed by those who have the proper rights to administer the layer.
The Permissions window allows you to manage who can view and download the data, who can edit the data, and who can manage the data.

#. Click on the Edit Layer button and select Edit Permissions
